Ever clicked “Yes” on a delete modal and instantly regretted it because you weren’t sure what would happen? Let’s make sure your users don’t go through that.

1. Clear Button Labels: Say no to vague labels like “Yes” or “No.” Use action-oriented text like “Yes, Delete” or “No, Keep It.”
2. Provide Context: Instead of “Delete Project?” say, “You’re about to delete the ‘Demo’ project. Are you sure?” Clarity avoids accidents.
3. Visual Hierarchy: Make destructive actions like “Delete” bold and red, while “Cancel” stays muted. Help users spot the difference at a glance.

These small tweaks build trust and save users from panic moments. Clear modals = happy users!
