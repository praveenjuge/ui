Alerts and toasts aren’t just there to deliver news—they’re an opportunity to guide users toward their next step.

1. Add Clear Actions: Pair alerts with helpful buttons like “Add,” “Fix,” or “Retry” to make it easy for users to resolve issues.
2. Keep It Relevant: Tailor the action button to match the message. For example, a “Retry” button for a failed payment or “Undo” for a completed action.

Helpful actions turn passive alerts into problem-solving moments for your users!
