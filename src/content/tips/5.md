Nobody likes wading through a wall of text. Make your content scannable and reader-friendly with these tips:

1. Use Short Paragraphs: Stick to 2-3 sentences per paragraph to keep things digestible.
2. Break It Up: Add headings, bullet points, or numbered lists to create visual breaks.

A little breathing room goes a long way in keeping your audience engaged!
