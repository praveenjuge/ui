Ever typed into a form field and forgot what it was for halfway through? Frustrating, right? That’s why visible labels are a lifesaver.

1. Keep Labels Visible: Avoid placeholder-only designs. Labels should always stay visible to guide users, especially in complex forms.
2. Validate Inputs Easily: Clear labels ensure users don’t second-guess what goes where, making forms less intimidating.

A simple tweak like visible labels can turn a confusing form into a user-friendly experience.
