Keyboard shortcuts are a power user’s best friend, but only if they’re easy to find and remember. Don’t make users dig through menus—give them shortcuts upfront.

1. Display Shortcuts Clearly: Show shortcut keys next to actions, like “Send Message (Cmd + Enter).” It’s a simple nudge that speeds things up.
2. Save Users Time: Placing shortcuts where actions happen reduces the need for memorization and keeps things flowing.

Power users love efficiency, and visible shortcuts are a quick win for boosting productivity in your design!
